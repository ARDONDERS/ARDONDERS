game outlay with multichoice assistant program everything once in the update server no changes possible in the program and only save in the external server carbon & electrode memory block
and the full prg on repeat clip and the update also on a repeat clip if one of the two is hacked, immediately renew and everything on a large new flat screen with boxes and a keyboard and mouse and controller (playstation)
p.s. I would like to see everything on a hologram basis and how it is put together and structured in beautiful show layouts and cool language and sound
-and maybe view everything from the game world
